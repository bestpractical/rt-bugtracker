=head1 NAME

RT::BugTracker - Adds a UI designed for bug-tracking for developers to RT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extension changes RT's UI to make more useful when you want to
track bug reports in many distributions. This extension is a start
for setups like L<http://rt.cpan.org>. It's been developed to help
authors of perl modules.

It follows several rules to achieve the goal:

=over 4

=item Each queue associated with one package (distribution).

=item Queue's AdminCc list is used for maintainers of the
coresponding distribution.

=item Not everything was possible to implement using callbacks
and other clean extending methods, so some files have been
overriden. We currently in sync with RT 3.6.6.
