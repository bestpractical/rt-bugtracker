=head1 NAME

RT::BugTracker - Adds a UI designed for bug-tracking for developers to RT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extension changes RT's interface to be more useful when you want
to track bug reports in many distributions. This extension is a start
for setups like L<http://rt.cpan.org>. It's been developed to help
authors of Perl modules.

In RT::BugTracker, every queue is a software "distribution".
RT::BugTracker adds a new F<Distribution> menu with options to search
and browse distributions. User and group rights apply normally to
queues through the Distribution menu search options.

Users can search distributions by maintainer through F<Distribution >
Search>. Maintainers are the AdminCc users and groups for
the distribution.

The search functions under the F<Distribution> menu return lists of
matching distributions. List items include a link to the bug list for
the distribution.

Bug list search results include columns for C<Severity>, C<Broken in>,
and C<Fixed in> custom fields. The C<Configuration> section, below,
describes how BugTracker administrators can configure these custom
fields.

The bug list search result page includes a link to the distribution's
C<Manage> page. Distribution maintainers and BugTracker admins can set
various attributes of the distribution here.

=head2 Distribution notes

These notes appear at the top of the distribution's bug list.

=head2 Additional addresses RT should notify

RT::BugTracker installs a new Scrip, C<On create and corresponds
notify additonal addresses>, that fires on distribution ticket
creation and comment transactions. This Scrip sets the C<To:> header
to the email addresses configured here.

=head2 Subject tag in addition to default

STUB: The additional subject tag is currently broken in 4.2/4.4. BPS will document this functionality when it is fixed.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

May need root permissions

=item C<make initdb>

RT::BugTracker creates several custom fields for tracking bugs; you may skip
this step if you intend to use different custom fields. See the section below
on L<Custom Fields>.

Only run this the first time you install this module.

If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data
in your database.

If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
in case changes need to be made to your database.

=item Edit your F</opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm>

Add this line:

    Plugin('RT::BugTracker');

=item Clear your mason cache

    rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

=item Restart your webserver

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 DistributionToQueueRegex

Some programming languages use characters in package names that may
not work well in email addresses. Perl modules use double colons,
'::', to separate package parents from children. BugTracker
administrators could name a distribution queue using these characters,
like 'Data::Dumper', for example. But the resulting public email
address for bug reports would be bugs-Data::Dumper@example.com.

While some characters may not be unallowed in email addresses,
BugTracker administrators may want to name their distribution queues
so that resulting public bug report addresses are more likely to get
through spam and other filters.

However, users want to search software distributions by the canonical
name of the package, like under Distributions > Search and
Distributions > Browse. Users expect to type "Data::Dumper" and find
the distribution queue named "Data-Dumper".

Use this config variable to define the character translation between
distribution search strings and distribution queue names. BugTracker
will use 'Pattern' and 'Substitution' in a subsitution regex
match. BugTracker will use this value:

Set(%DistributionToQueueRegex,
    'Pattern' => '::',
    'Substitution' => '-'
);

like this:

s/::/-/g

The values above translate Perl module names into their email-friendly
counterpart queue names.

=head2 BugTracker_CustomFieldsOnUpdate

Use this config variable to specify a list of custom field names to
display on the ticket reply page for privileged users. By default it
displays "Fixed in" to help maintainers quickly close out issues as the
fixes are released.

=head2 BugTracker_SearchResultFormat

Use this config variable to specify the search result format for a
distribution's list of tickets, much like C<DefaultSearchResultFormat>
in core RT.

=head2 BugTracker_HideBrowseDistributions

Use this config variable to suppress the alphabetical distribution browser
UI, for users with fewer than tens of thousands of queues. :)

=head2 BugTracker_ShowAllDistributions

Use this config variable to always display all distributions, for users
with fewer than hundreds of queues. :)

=head2 Custom Fields

By default, when you run C<make initdb>, RT::BugTracker creates three
custom fields on queues, globally, with empty values.

=over 4

=item Severity

Bug severity levels, like 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'.

=item Broken in

The distribution version where the bug in the ticket first
appeared. Since each distribution will have different release
versions, the BugTracker admin will need top populate these values for
each distribution.

=item Fixed in

The distribution version where the bug in the ticket was fixed. Since
each distribution will have different release versions, the BugTracker
admin will need top populate these values for each distribution.

=back

You may choose to skip creation of these custom fields by skipping the
C<make initdb> step. If you would like to use your own custom fields,
you should investigate setting the C<BugTracker_CustomFieldsOnUpdate>
and C<BugTracker_SearchResultFormat> config options documented above.
