<h3>WARNING: Queue is disabled</h3>

<p>This queue has been disabled by maintainers' request. Heh, it's still possible to create bugs using UI and may be email address, but we <b>beg you</b> "don't create new tickets". Instead read distribution's documentation and figure out how to report issues properly.</p>

<p>Sorry for this. Later we'll provid more info here and disable creation of reports entirly.</p>
