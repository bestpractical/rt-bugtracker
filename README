NAME
    RT::BugTracker - Adds a UI designed for bug-tracking for developers to
    RT

DESCRIPTION
    This extension changes RT's interface to be more useful when you want to
    track bug reports in many distributions. This extension is a start for
    setups like <http://rt.cpan.org>. It's been developed to help authors of
    Perl modules.

    It follows two basic rules to achieve the goal:

    Each queue associated with one package (distribution).
    Queue's AdminCc list is used for maintainers of the coresponding
    distribution.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::BugTracker));

        or add RT::BugTracker to your existing @Plugins line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver
