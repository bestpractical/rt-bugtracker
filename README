NAME
    RT::BugTracker - Adds a UI designed for bug-tracking for developers to
    RT

DESCRIPTION
    This extension changes RT's interface to be more useful when you want to
    track bug reports in many distributions. This extension is a start for
    setups like <http://rt.cpan.org>. It's been developed to help authors of
    Perl modules.

    In RT::BugTracker, every queue is a software "distribution".
    RT::BugTracker adds a new Distribution menu with options to search and
    browse distributions. User and group rights apply normally to queues
    through the Distribution menu search options.

    Users can search distributions by maintainer through Distribution
    Search>. Maintainers are the AdminCc users and groups for the
    distribution.

    The search functions under the Distribution menu return lists of
    matching distributions. List items include a link to the bug list for
    the distribution.

    Bug list search results include columns for Severity, Broken in, and
    Fixed in custom fields. The Configuration section, below, describes how
    BugTracker administrators can configure these custom fields.

    The bug list search result page includes a link to the distribution's
    Manage page. Distribution maintainers and BugTracker admins can set
    various attributes of the distribution here.

  Distribution notes
    These notes appear at the top of the distribution's bug list.

  Additional addresses RT should notify
    RT::BugTracker installs a new Scrip, On create and corresponds notify
    additonal addresses, that fires on distribution ticket creation and
    comment transactions. This Scrip sets the To: header to the email
    addresses configured here.

  Subject tag in addition to default
    STUB: The additional subject tag is currently broken in 4.2/4.4. BPS
    will document this functionality when it is fixed.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        RT::BugTracker creates several custom fields for tracking bugs; you
        may skip this step if you intend to use different custom fields. See
        the section below on "Custom Fields".

        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt5/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::BugTracker');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt5/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
  DistributionToQueueRegex
    Some programming languages use characters in package names that may not
    work well in email addresses. Perl modules use double colons, '::', to
    separate package parents from children. BugTracker administrators could
    name a distribution queue using these characters, like 'Data::Dumper',
    for example. But the resulting public email address for bug reports
    would be bugs-Data::Dumper@example.com.

    While some characters may not be unallowed in email addresses,
    BugTracker administrators may want to name their distribution queues so
    that resulting public bug report addresses are more likely to get
    through spam and other filters.

    However, users want to search software distributions by the canonical
    name of the package, like under Distributions > Search and Distributions
    > Browse. Users expect to type "Data::Dumper" and find the distribution
    queue named "Data-Dumper".

    Use this config variable to define the character translation between
    distribution search strings and distribution queue names. BugTracker
    will use 'Pattern' and 'Substitution' in a subsitution regex match.
    BugTracker will use this value:

    Set(%DistributionToQueueRegex, 'Pattern' => '::', 'Substitution' => '-'
    );

    like this:

    s/::/-/g

    The values above translate Perl module names into their email-friendly
    counterpart queue names.

  BugTracker_CustomFieldsOnUpdate
    Use this config variable to specify a list of custom field names to
    display on the ticket reply page for privileged users. By default it
    displays "Fixed in" to help maintainers quickly close out issues as the
    fixes are released.

  BugTracker_SearchResultFormat
    Use this config variable to specify the search result format for a
    distribution's list of tickets, much like DefaultSearchResultFormat in
    core RT.

  BugTracker_HideBrowseDistributions
    Use this config variable to suppress the alphabetical distribution
    browser UI, for users with fewer than tens of thousands of queues. :)

  BugTracker_ShowAllDistributions
    Use this config variable to always display all distributions, for users
    with fewer than hundreds of queues. :)

  Custom Fields
    By default, when you run make initdb, RT::BugTracker creates three
    custom fields on queues, globally, with empty values.

    Severity
        Bug severity levels, like 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High'.

    Broken in
        The distribution version where the bug in the ticket first appeared.
        Since each distribution will have different release versions, the
        BugTracker admin will need top populate these values for each
        distribution.

    Fixed in
        The distribution version where the bug in the ticket was fixed.
        Since each distribution will have different release versions, the
        BugTracker admin will need top populate these values for each
        distribution.

    You may choose to skip creation of these custom fields by skipping the
    make initdb step. If you would like to use your own custom fields, you
    should investigate setting the BugTracker_CustomFieldsOnUpdate and
    BugTracker_SearchResultFormat config options documented above.
