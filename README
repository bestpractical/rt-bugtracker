NAME
    RT::BugTracker - Adds a UI designed for bug-tracking for developers to
    RT

DESCRIPTION
    This extension changes RT's UI to make more useful when you want to
    track bug reports in many distributions. This extension is a start for
    setups like <http://rt.cpan.org>. It's been developed to help authors of
    perl modules.

    It follows several rules to achieve the goal:

    Each queue associated with one package (distribution).
    Queue's AdminCc list is used for maintainers of the coresponding
    distribution.
    Not everything was possible to implement using callbacks and other clean
    extending methods, so some files have been overriden. We currently in
    sync with RT 3.6.6.
