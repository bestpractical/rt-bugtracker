NAME
    RT::BugTracker - Adds a UI designed for bug-tracking for developers to
    RT

DESCRIPTION
    This extension changes RT's interface to be more useful when you want to
    track bug reports in many distributions. This extension is a start for
    setups like <http://rt.cpan.org>. It's been developed to help authors of
    Perl modules.

    It follows two basic rules to achieve the goal:

    Each queue associated with one package (distribution).
    Queue's AdminCc list is used for maintainers of the coresponding
    distribution.
